== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is Weglot Translate free? =
Weglot Translate is a freemium plugin: it is free for small websites (under 2000 words) with one translation language. If you need more, you can upgrade. Details of our pricing can be found here: https://weglot.com/pricingwp

In any case, you can try Weglot free for 10 days.
= Edit my translations =
With Weglot Translate, you can modify translations in "Translations" in your Weglot account here: https://weglot.com/dashboard. If you change a translation, it's automatically saved and displayed on your website.
= The translations I edited are not displayed on my website. =

All translations edited in your dashboard are automatically displayed in real-time in the translated versions of your website. If you can not see your new translations:

1. Empty your cache plugin: it will enable new translations to be properly displayed. If it's still not showing your new translations then:

2. Go into your Weglot account and check you edited the right translations: use the search bar (at the top) to easily find translations you want to edit. Sometimes you can have 2 very similar translations and edited the wrong one.

= Change the appearance of the Weglot Translate language button =
You can change one of the three set-up items in your Weglot Translate settings (with/without flags, horizontal or dropdown menu, full language name or 2-letter code) or overwrite the CSS.
= Change the position of the Weglot Translate language button =
With widget areas, you can drag and drop the Weglot Translate widget.

Alternatively, use overwrite CSS to change the Weglot Translate button position or ask the Weglot Translate team at support@weglot.com. We will help you.

You can also put the button in the navigation menu by checking the option in the Weglot settings page. Be aware that putting the button in the menu might change the appearance of the button a bit as there are already some style (CSS) rules active in the menu.

You can additionally use a shortcode: [weglot_switcher]

Finally, you can also add &lt;div id=&quot;weglot_here&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; anywhere in your code and a Weglot button will be positioned at this place.
= SEO and translations =
Weglot Translate creates a dedicated URL for each language to ensure the proper indexation of your translated content by Search Engines (Google, ...). SEO tags are also translated and editable in your Weglot Translate account. Translated pages will be on a sub-directory.
= Translated URLs =
Weglot Translate chooses to not translate URLs, as this could break URLs with non-Roman characters (for example, Chinese, Russian alphabets) and it has no proven impact on SEO. Finally, Google, Amazon, Airbnb, etc... are not doing it.
= Translate image/video =
With Weglot Translate, you can add different images for different languages. This is useful if you have text in an image and you want to display a translated image in your translated version. To do this, you can simply upload your other translated image in your gallery and then link it by going to your dashboard and searching for the original URL in the translations list.
= Translation exclusions =
You can exclude pages from translations if you don't want them to be translated or just part of pages by using CSS selectors.
To do this, go in the WordPress panel -&gt; Weglot settings page and use the field "Translation Exclusion".

= Translation exceptions =
You can create your own translation rules in your Weglot dashboard by clicking on Translation Options, allowing you to:

1. Add Exception Rules, such as "Never translate" or "Always translate" a word/expression in a custom way (for example, if you do not want to translate your brand name).

2. Use the "Search and Replace" tool to easily search for a word in all your translations and replace it with the one you want.

= Support =
If you have any questions about Weglot Translate, please post a topic on https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weglot or contact us at support@weglot.com or directly using our live chat on https://weglot.com.
